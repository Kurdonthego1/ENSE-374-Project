Our first solution was a simple web application for tracking a workout features included were
- Ability to “start” a workout and add different exercises to the workout.
- Simple and easy use of application, didn’t involve user sign up/log in to access data.

However we found that this solution would be missing lots of a the necessary features that would actually accomplish our goal of making tracking of exercises easier, as each time you started a workout, your previous workout data wouldn’t exist and therefore the action of logging your workout would only serve to benefit that individual workout. 

This solution is a great idea for users who have never used a workout app and would like to see how it works for themselves, or for users who seldom go to the gym, but don't take it too seriously. As mentioned earlier, if these users want to start tracking their exercise and become more consistent with working out, they would need more features, which is something solution lacks.

Our second solution is again a web application that would track workouts, this time utilizing user sign up/log in and data storing features, it would allow us to better provide the user with functions to make their workout tracking experience easier. 

Features would include:
- Start a workout from recommended templates or saved templates that the user has created
- Save last workout data for an exercise, showing what the user last did in terms of reps and sets for a    particular exercise.
- View exercises data to see improvement of different intervals of time
- This is our current WIP solution, however we are still developing and figuring out features to better serve the user.
