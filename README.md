## Project Overview
FitBro is a workout tracker application that guides users by being able to provide customized workouts, which evidently, assists them with time management at the gym, along with retention and consistency. 
FitBro hopes to provide an easy-to-use, accurate, and reliable workout tracking application that helps its users track their workouts, identify their performance, and make it an easier experience to care for your health at the gym.
We believe there is a need for an application that is tailored towards expereinced and first-time gym-goers that will help with workut tracking, as there has been a strong surge of people who want to start building good habits by working out.
