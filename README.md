Initial Designs
<a href="">

</a>
</h3>

Over the past weeks, each member was tasked with making their own LoFi design, and gaining feedback from at least 2 gym going users. Afterwards the team came back together and produced a final LoFi design with the feedback from the users as to which pages they liked the most. Afterwards an additional user feedback round was used to make any changes to the LoFi design. Changes included
 Search bar addition to add exercise page.
Workout Templates rather than recommended exercises.
Addition of visuals in the “start a workout page”
After this, development of a functional prototype is now beginning.
